# Deciding What to Do

There were many options and career paths for me to choose from. For a majority of high school, I was set on becoming a veterinarian. But did I really want to spend the next 40 years of putting down dogs and relaying bad news to hopeful pet owners? Turns out, the "boring" and "miserable" cubicle jobs my friends all spend their time avoiding seemed to be exactly what I was looking for.

After deciding that veterinary school wasn't for me, I scrambled to find the next best thing. What was I interested in? A good question. Not much. What do I want to do for the rest of my life? A daunting question asked to any 17 year old. 

I would scroll through career listing websites for hours and took numerous career placing tests, but none of the listings ever caught my eye. Close to giving up hope, I took one last career test. This time I decided to answer the questions with what I really wanted, instead of basing my answers off what my parents told me, or what I thought would make good income. I finished the quiz, and in my top three matches appeared: [Software Programmer](https://www.herzing.edu/description/computer-programmer)

Interested, I clicked to learn more. *Could I really do this?* I thought to myself as I read the job description. As I kept reading, it seemed to get more interesting, especially as my eyes caught the listed salary. *And a good salary?!* I was hooked.
