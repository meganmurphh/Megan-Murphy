# My Time at Mizzou

Honestly speaking, there have been more downs than ups in the 2 months that I've been here, but I still enjoy college life. It's definitely a hard adjustment, but nobody said it was easy.

I'm learning a lot about myself as a student, especially during midterm time. My work ethic, mental capacity, and physical state have all been challenged in some way, but I'm proud to say that I've been able to overcome all obstacles.

I most proud to say that I really enjoy the IT program here at Mizzou, and don't regret my random decision to try out what the program has to offer. Coding has been suprisingly easy enough for me to learn, and I'm excited and eager to get into the more advanced stuff.

In conclusion, I still from time-to-time think about how crazy it is that I go here. It truly feels like a full circle moment for me. I'm grateful to be able to recieve such a good education and also have a good time doing it.
