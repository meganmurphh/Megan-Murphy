# Moving to Mizzou

Come late September, I finally recieved an email regarding my fate at Mizzou. Accepted. I couldn't believe it. **_I'm going to Mizzou._** My top school. My *dream* school.

While I was excited to go to Mizzou, I did put off a lot of the incoming freshman deadlines. As my senior year went on, they seemed to sneak up on me, and I would often find myself rushing to beat the deadline.

In early January, I started to panick as I realized the window to find a roommate was rapidly closing, as the deadline was **February 1st**. I frantically messaged people on Facebook trying to find a match. It wasn't until late January when I finally made my decision. With little to no luck in finding anyone, a girl that I had talked to earlier in the month reached back out to me and asked to be roommates. Desperate and trying to avoid a random assignment at all costs, I hastily said yes.

After I had found a roommate, the next thing to do was look for furniture. I was so excited to finally be able to pick out my own things now that I was going to live on my own. I made numerous lists describing the things that I needed, and the things that I thought that I needed. Needless to say, **it was a lot of stuff.** More than I had expected. 

When move-in day had finally arrived, I found myself ill-prepared, and panic mode set in when I realized that really only had half of what I needed. I was mad at myself for not taking my move seriously.
